# ClawTwister
MIDI Fighter Twister mapping to OpenClaw AI or automation systems.

MIDI-based parameter modulation and telemetry interface for AI and automation systems.

ClawTwister maps hardware controls (specifically MIDI Fighter Twister from DJ Tech Tools) to dynamic parameters and feedback surfaces. It enables real-time human modulation of system behavior and state visualization, serving as a tactile layer for experimentation with multi-agent or automation systems.

Features:
OpenClaw-compatible design
MIDI input/output
parameter mapping
real-time feedback (where supported)
research-friendly architecture

Use Cases:
